<p>This book of 1,449.5 random sandwich recipes was created for <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017" target="_blank">NaNoGenMo (National Novel Generation Month) 2017</a>. You can view the source code for this project on <a href="https://github.com/daveschumaker/Random-Sandwiches" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>It uses data parsed from a 1909 book, entitled <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Up_to_date_Sandwich_Book.html?id=qTIEAAAAYAAJ" target="_blank">"The Up-To-Date Sandwich Book: 400 Ways to Make a Sandwich"</a>, written by Eva Greene Fuller and now available for free in the public domain.</a></p>
<p>For this particular book, new sandwich recipes were generated using Markov chains created from the above text.</p>
<p>Please don't try to actually make any of the sandwich recipes created with this process. However, if you do, please <a href="https://twitter.com/davely" target="_blank">contact me</a> and show me pictures.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I cannot be held responsible for any health issues that may arise from eating any of these sandwiches.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
